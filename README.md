# MicrosoftLearning - DP-203: Data Engineering on MS Azure

Fork of the [official repository](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/dp-203-azure-data-engineer) of DP-203 with the following fixes:

- Set static delay (15 sec) in the deployment phase to optimizing the length of provisioning
- Reduce the available datacenters to EN-US, deployments frequently failing with other Azure Regions
